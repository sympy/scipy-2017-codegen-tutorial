    "\n",
    "[Cython](http://cython.org/) is a **compiler** and a **programming language** used to generate C [extension modules](https://docs.python.org/3.6/extending/extending.html) for Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cython *language* is a Python/C [creole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creole_language) which is essentially Python with some additional keywords for specifying static data types. It looks something like this:\n",

    "        s += i\n",
    "    return s\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cython *compiler* transforms this code into a \"flavor\" of C specific to Python extension modules. This C code is then compiled into a binary file that can be imported and used just like a regular Python module -- the difference being that the functions you use from that module can potentially be much faster and more efficient than an equivalent pure Python implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from writing Cython code for computations, Cython is commonly used for writing *wrappers* around existing C code so that the functions therein can be made available in an extension module as described above. We will use this technique to make the SymPy-generated C code accessible to Python for use in SciPy's `odeint`."
