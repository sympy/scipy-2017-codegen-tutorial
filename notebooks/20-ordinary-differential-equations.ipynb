    "Well, that was easy: 100 points gave us almost plotting accuracy. Unfortunately, Euler forward is not practical for most real world problems. Usually we want a higher order formula (the error in euler forward scales only as $n^{-1}$), and we want to use an adaptive step size (larger steps when the function is smooth). Furthermore, for a large class of problems, we need to base the step not on the derivative at the current time point, but rather at the next time point (giving rise to an implicit expression). We will not go into the details of this at all. Instead we will use the well tested LSODA algorithm (provided in scipy as ``odeint``):"
