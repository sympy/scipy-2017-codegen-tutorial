    "In chemistry one is often interested in how fast a chemical process proceeds. Chemical reactions (when viewed as single events on a molecular scale) are probabilitic. However, most reactive systems of interest involve very large number of molecules (a few grams of a simple substance containts on the order of $10^{23}$ molecules. The sheer number allows us to describe this inherently stochastic process deterministically.\n",
